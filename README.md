# ShyphirasSting

This was the first game I did as a term project in the BTech Games Dev program at BCIT in the Fall term 2013.

This was done in a group of four members. I personally worked on UI, sound and maybe text, I don't remember.

It's just a simple 3D platformer where you play as a poorly modeled dragon.

Written in C# using Microsoft's XNA framework.
